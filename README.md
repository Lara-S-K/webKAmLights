## About
This is a minimalistic program for an ESP32 to control the DIY Webcam lights built in our workshop.

You can use any tool to flash the ESP, but we recommend PlatformIO together with vsCode https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode

Read more about the PWM output (used as brightness control for the LEDS) on the ESP documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html#ledc-api-configure-channel
